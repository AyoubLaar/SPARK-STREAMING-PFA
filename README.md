# Spark Real time tweets sentiment analysis

## Description
The primary objectives of this project are to gather a substantial dataset of tweets related to the Israel-Palestine conflict and analyze public sentiment. This involves implementing an automated method to categorize tweets based on specific hashtags, distinguishing between different stances on the conflict. To ensure high-quality input for sentiment analysis, thorough data preprocessing is performed to standardize and clean the text. The project also aims to train and evaluate machine learning models to accurately classify the sentiment of the tweets, achieving high accuracy and robust performance metrics. Additionally, the project facilitates real-time processing and analysis of tweets, providing up-to-date insights into public sentiment on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
